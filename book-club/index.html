        At UX Reads & Reacts, we believe that learning is a journey best taken together.
        This book club is a space where developers, designers, and curious minds come together
        to explore the world of coding, web development, and user experience through the lens
        of continuous learning. Each month, we dive into books, articles, and resources that
        spark conversation about design thinking, accessibility, emerging technologies, and the
        human side of building digital experiences. But we don’t just read — we react. Our discussions
        encourage members to share insights, challenge ideas, and connect theory with practice.
        Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting your coding journey, UX Reads & Reacts
        offers a welcoming community where knowledge grows, creativity thrives, and every voice matters.
