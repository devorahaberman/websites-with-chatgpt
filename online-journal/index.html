        <summary>Chunk's New Favorite Nap Spot</summary>
        <div class="entry-body">
          <p class="entry-date"><time datetime="2025-12-03">Dec 3, 2025</time></p>

            Today Chunk discovered that the laundry basket (filled, of course) is officially a luxury bed.
            He settled in, hogged the blanket, and performed the patented Mastiff snore-symphony while I attempted
            to fold two shirts. The zoomies came at sunset and the couch lost dignity. 10/10 would recommend investing
            in a bigger basket.

        <summary>The Great Drool Pool Incident</summary>
        <div class="entry-body">

            Took Chunk to the park and he found a puddle that was basically a small ocean. He treated it like a spa,
            splashing, rolling, and generously redecorating my shoes. Spent the evening with towels, treats, and a
            surprisingly calm Chunk who clearly felt cleansed by his muddy dip.

        <summary>Mailman vs. The Gentle Giant</summary>
        <div class="entry-body">
          <p class="entry-date"><time datetime="2025-12-01">Dec 1, 2025</time></p>
          <p>
            A very important package arrived. Chunk announced its arrival with a single, dignified bork — then inspected
            the box for quality control. The mail carrier gave Chunk a biscuit and then treated him like royalty. Both
            parties left satisfied.

        <summary>First Snow: Observations From the Porch</summary>
        <div class="entry-body">
          <p class="entry-date"><time datetime="2025-11-30">Nov 30, 2025</time></p>
          <p>
            The first dusting of snow made Chunk act like he'd never seen flakes before — pensive, then suspicious,
            then ecstatic. He attempted to catch a snowflake and ended up with a frosty beard. Spent 20 minutes trying
            to convince him that snow is not edible (he disagrees).
